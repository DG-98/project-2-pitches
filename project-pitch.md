# API
I will be using the RAWG video game database API which you can find here (https://rawg.io/apidocs)

# ERD

# API Calls
- https://api.rawg.io/api/games/{id} - get details of a specific game 
- https://api.rawg.io/api/games/{id}/achievements - get achievements for a game 
- https://api.rawg.io/api/games/{game_pk}/screenshots - get screenshots for a game
# MVP Goals 
- The ability to search games and view relevant info related to the game
- The ability to favorite games and view your favorites 
- The ability to favorite game developers and also view that list 
- The ability to remove games and developers from their respective lists. 

# Stretch Goals
- Links to outside sites like the steam or playstation site for games
- Ability to watch trailers on games on the site

# Potential Roadblocks 
I see some roadblocks for me popping up when it comes to orginization of the routes and handling proper API calls.
